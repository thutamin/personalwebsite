				In the near future, while pursuing my degree at UTS, I would like to volunteer in projects as a programmer to enhance my coding skills as well as gain a wider knowledge and experience of the computing field.
			</p>
			<p>
				After graduation, if opportunities present, I would like to work as a software developer in the robotic or Artificial Intelligence sectors. I am a fellow Math and Code enthusiast and thus, those fields hold my utmost interest now.
			</p>
			<p>
				But to be honest, although I have strong interest in those fields, I am still open minded to other fields or new fields as one can never know when much cooler technologies and algorithms will be founded or invented or developed.
