				Website Overview
			</h2>
			<p>
				As a firm advocate of simple and subtle websites being the best, this website was built and designed with a simplistic and nature theme. As such, no animations, gif or videos have been included in this website. Inclusion of images has also been limited to a minimal amount as too much images can overwhelm the contents. Thus, this site was designed with a simple and subtle approach where the user will not focus too much on the design than the contents.

				<h2>
				Aesthetic
			</h2>
			<h3>
				Color
			</h3>
			<p>
				The initial design of the website was a simple black and white approach. But upon completion, the design was too simple and the contrast black text on white was nowhere near subtle. Hence, after several variations, the website was finished with grey (as in the color of stone) on a snow background giving the website less contrast with a sense of hue.  Moreover, users will also realize that a taint of green has also been added to the website upon hovering the pointer on the navigation bar.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Font
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Depending on the contents throughout the website, various font sizes are used.</li>
				<li>All texts have the same font styles, font color and font weight except for the texts in table, the title and the text in the footer.</li>
				<li>The texts in the title, footer and table headers are white in color. The table headers are also bold.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>
				Interactivity

				<li>To illustrates interaction, an underline will appear under the navigation option and the text will turn green upon hovering the pointer on the top navigation bar.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>
